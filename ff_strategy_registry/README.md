### Ideas
I am thinking of making registry only to find the ip addresses of strategies. 
Then the GUI direct connects to the strategy and this way we can log in, log out and the strategy can keep its own event buffer on disk, we just load and stream events.

#### Advantages
- Only 1 strategy window needs to be in state
- Less congested stream
- easy development
