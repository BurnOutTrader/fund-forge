The default max size is 10, with 10 adds unless specified otherwise.
This strategy benefits from a larger max size, it is a pyramiding trend trader.

Currencies should use a max balance, so that they take profits on a big run up and avoid trailing drawdown limits.
The drawdowns seem a lot more contained in semi automated trading on 5 min, even if profits are less than 1 min.

const RENKO_RANGE: Decimal = dec!(0.00005);
const MAX_SIZE: Decimal = dec!(10);
const MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE: Decimal = dec!(300);
5 min candles

Doesnt test well (but need to test in bull trend)

6A
const RENKO_RANGE: Decimal = dec!(0.0025);
const MAX_SIZE: Decimal = dec!(10);
const MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE: Decimal = dec!(300);

6B (the best testing currency)
const RENKO_RANGE: Decimal = dec!(0.0025);
const MAX_SIZE: Decimal = dec!(10);
const MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE: Decimal = dec!(300);


MNQ
const RENKO_RANGE: Decimal = dec!(20);
const MAX_SIZE: Decimal = dec!(10);
const MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE: Decimal = dec!(300);
1 min candle setting achieves the highest profit but with significantly higher drawdown (50%)
5 min setting offers slightly lower profit but with better risk management
